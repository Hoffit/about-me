# *Welcome to My Multiverse!*

## This is a simple web site that is created as a part of a training program at Code Fellows.

It's inspired by my love of the animated TV show: *Rick and Morty". The image above is from one of my favorite episodes "Pickle Rick".

### What it does

It's a simple interactive web site that poses questions to the user with subject matter based on things about me. Like places I've lived, my age, or my favorite tv show Rick and Morty!

#### Technology

It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
