# *Welcome to My Multiverse!*

## This is a simple web site that is created as a part of a training program at Code Fellows.

It's inspired by my love of the animated TV show: *"Rick and Morty"*. The image above is from one of my favorite episodes "Pickle Rick".

### What it does
It's a simple interactive web site that poses questions to the user with subject matter based on things about me. Like places I've lived, my age, or my favorite tv show *"Rick and Morty"*

#### Technology
It uses HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

##### Updated June 7 2018
Migrated all hard coded question code into re-usable functions.

###### Pair Programming
I served as Driver, Navigator, and Observer through 3 cycles, for the 3 of us.
The other 2 contributors were Andy and Tom.
